                    <p class="mb-4">For optimal account security, it’s recommended to follow these best practices:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Always create a password that is at least eight characters long and includes a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information, such as birthdays or common words.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> For enhanced protection, ensure MFA is activated on your account. This adds an additional layer of security, requiring you to enter a one-time verification code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password when logging in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regularly Update Your Password:</strong> It’s recommended to update your password periodically (e.g., every 90 days) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. You can update your password through the account settings page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Account Activity:</strong> Keep an eye on any unusual activity in your account, such as unauthorized logins or changes to your profile. If you notice anything suspicious, change your password immediately and report the incident to your administrator.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3.4 Logging Out</h3>

To log out, simply click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select <strong>Log Out</strong> from the dropdown menu.</p>
                    <p>Logging out ensures that your account remains secure and prevents unauthorized access to your documents and comparison reports.</p>

                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mb-2">
                                <li>Managing users (adding, removing, and editing user profiles).</li>
                                <li>Controlling document uploads, deletions, and version management.</li>

                        <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Viewers have read-only access to the system. They can view uploaded documents and comparison reports but cannot make changes. This role is ideal for individuals who need access to final reports but do not contribute to document creation or comparison processes. Viewer responsibilities include:

                        <li><strong>Document Management:</strong> Control who can upload, delete, or update documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison Reports:</strong> Determine which users can generate, view, or edit comparison reports.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Restrict or allow access to the user management system, including the ability to add or edit user roles.</li>
                        <li><strong>System Settings:</strong> Decide which users can access and modify core system settings, such as role assignment and permission customization.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4.4 Role-Based Workflow</h3>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5.3 File Size Limitations</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">To ensure optimal performance, there are certain file size limitations in place. Users can upload files up to <strong>100 MB</strong> in size per document. Larger files may require longer processing times or be rejected if they exceed the size limit.</p>
                    <p>If you need to upload large documents or multiple files, we recommend compressing the files beforehand or breaking them into smaller parts, if possible.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5.4 Data Importation from Excel</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">In addition to traditional document formats, users can import data directly from Excel spreadsheets for document preparation or comparison. The system supports both <strong>.xls</strong> and <strong>.xlsx</strong> formats. This feature allows users to:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">This functionality is especially useful for users who manage large datasets, financial reports, or academic papers, allowing quick and accurate comparisons of complex data.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5.5 Preparing Documents from Other Resources</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Users can also prepare documents for comparison by importing content from various sources, such as:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Upload documents directly from services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox.</li>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li>Ensure your documents are named clearly and descriptively to make them easier to identify after upload.</li>
                        <li>For multiple uploads, organize files into relevant folders on your device before uploading to ensure a smooth process.</li>
                        <li>If uploading sensitive documents, ensure they comply with any company or legal data security policies.</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">The document comparison tool leverages a powerful <strong>text and structural comparison algorithm</strong>. This algorithm compares the documents line by line, identifying changes in content, structure, and formatting. It looks for:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Textual Differences:</strong> Detects any changes in wording, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structural Changes:</strong> Compares document structure, including sections, headings, bullet points, and indentation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Formatting:</strong> Highlights changes in font styles, size, and document layout (optional setting).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">The comparison algorithm processes the documents to provide a detailed report highlighting all changes, making it easy to review document updates and revisions.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6.3 Viewing Comparison Results</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Once the comparison is complete, the results are displayed in a detailed report. The differences between the documents are highlighted for quick identification:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li><span class="text-red-500">Red:</span> Text that has been <strong>removed</strong> from the original document.</li>

                        <li><strong>Summary View:</strong> Provides a high-level overview of the changes, summarizing key differences without going into too much detail.</li>
                        <li><strong>Detailed View:</strong> Displays all changes in detail, including minor formatting differences and small text changes.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6.4 Handling Complex Documents</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">For large or complex documents, the system breaks down the comparison into manageable sections, ensuring that all changes are processed efficiently. This allows users to focus on specific sections of the document if needed, making it easier to compare lengthy reports or detailed technical documents.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6.5 Additional Features</h3>
